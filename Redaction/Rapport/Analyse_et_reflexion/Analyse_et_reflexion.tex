\section{Reflexions sur la duree de vie}
\subsection{Durée de vie du reseau, problématique}
\subsection{Differentes définitions}
Les definitions et critères de durée de vie d'un WSN sont tirés des articles \cite{Dietrich2009},\cite{Champ2009lifetime},\cite{Elleithy2011}.

\begin{enumerate}
 
\item Energy-Efficiency (EE)
\item Time To First Fail (TTFF)
\item Operative Nodes Percentage (ONP)
\item Monitored Interest Points Percentage (MIPP)
\item The time there is at least a certain fraction $\beta$ of surviving nodes in the network 
\item The time until all nodes have been drained of their energy 
\item K-coverage: the time the area of interest is covered by at least k nodes 
\item 100 $\textperthousand$
a. The time each target is covered by at least one node  ;
b. The time the whole area is covered by at least one node  ;

\item$\alpha$-coverage
a. The accumulated time during which at least $\alpha$ portion of the region is covered by
at least one node ;
b. The time until the coverage drops below a predefined threshold $\alpha$ (until last drop
below threshold)  ;
c. The continuous operational time of the system before either the coverage or
delivery ratio first drops below a predefined threshold ;

\item The number of successful data-gathering trips
\item The number of total transmitted messages 
\item The percentage of nodes that have a path to the base station
\item Expectation of the entire interval during which the probability of guaranteeing connectivity and k-coverage simultaneously is at least $\alpha$
\item The time until connectivity or coverage are lost
\item The time until the network no longer provides an acceptable event detection ratio
\item The time period during which the network continuously satisfies the application requirement
\item min(t1, t2, t3)
with t1: time for cardinality of largest connected component of
communication graph to drop below c1 $\times$ n(t), t2: time for n(t) to drop below c2 $\times$ n, t3:
time for the covered volume to drop below c3 $\times$ l d .
\end{enumerate}
